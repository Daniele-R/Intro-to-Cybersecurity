# ECE 4309 - Introduction to Cybersecurity
In this class, we covered the basics of Cybersecurity, and with that, we were given the opportunity to create a project of our choice that was related to Cybersecurity. Thus, we decided to cover the basics of Ransomware, the utilization of VMs for testing, and the background of these malwares.

## Notes
- For this course, we had to make groups of 4 members.
- My focus for this project was "WannaCry Report.pdf".
- The combination of all the reports is "Ransomware Report.pdf".
- A presentation was made to the class, this one is "Ransomeware Presentation.pdf"
- All members had to test each others ransomware for further undertanding.
